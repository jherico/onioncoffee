Maxmind's GeoIP jar is not currently (04/2009) available on public 
repositories. However, the source code for their jar is available at 
'http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/java/'.  Using the included 
geoip.pom.xml, you can build and install the GeoIP api jar locally with the 
following steps.  (This assumes you have Maven 2 properly installed and 
working).

    1. Download and unzip the GeoIPJava-1.2.2.zip.  This should create a new
       directory.
    2. Copy the geoip.pom.xml file to the new directory, renaming it to 
	   pom.xml.
    3. Run the command 'mvn source:jar install' to build and install the 
       GeoIP jar to your local repository.
       
Maven builds of the TorJava projet should now be able to locate and use the 
jar file.
